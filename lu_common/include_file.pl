# This script reads the main input file, given with --input=<filename>

# Within it, it locates all sections of text between:
# /* BEGIN_INCLUDE_FILE "filename" */
# ...
# until
# /* END_INCLUDE_FILE "filename" */

# It then looks up the file filename, and compares the contents.
# Basically, we want to copy the contents from the file filename into
# the input file.  But, the usage of this script is that the user most
# likely rather is editing the code snippets from within the input
# file instead, so we want to copy the contents into the file named
# filename.  To keep track of which version has changed, we use an
# md5sum of the contents (in both the file itself, and the chunk in
# the input file.  This md5sum should match the text (excluding the
# surrounding junk, and the md5sum itself.  If it does not match, then
# that copy is expected to have been changed, (is newer), and is the
# one that should be used.  If both copies have been changed, we
# declare confusion and refuse to operate further.

# The include filenames are made relative to the directory containing
# the input file.

# The use of the script is to be able to have the parser .y and lexer
# .lex files distributed in many files (although lex and bison) cannot
# handle includes.  We cannot use the C preprocessor to include the
# files, since then the error messages and line numbers will come from
# the concatenated file, and not the original source file.  This
# script is to make it possible to 'maintain' the source in several
# files, but such that all copying between them operates automatically
# (sort of).

# To insert a chunk of text the first time, write:
# /* NEW_INCLUDE_FILE "filename" */
# Where it is wanted in the input file.

# In case of double change, replacing BEGIN_INCLUDE_FILE with
# DISCARD_THIS_INCLUDE_FILE or DISCARD_FILE_INCLUDE_FILE can be used
# to tell which one should be kept.
