/* Using the external_writer to create a custom ntuple/root/structure
 *
 * - Create an external_writer object.
 *
 * - Call init() to set the internal shm/pipe communication buffers up,
 *   and fork the appropriate external program, {hbook,root,struct}_writer.
 *
 *   @type         Type of output, combination of the NTUPLE_... values
 *                 defined in staged_ntuple.hh  (except for this, that
 *                 header file is not needed.)  Basically, one of the
 *                 NTUPLE_TYPE_... values, and on of NTUPLE_CASE_...
 *                 should be or|ed together.  The NTUPLE_WRITER_... are
 *                 not used by the external_writer.
 *
 *   @no_shm       Set to true to disable the shared memory communication,
 *                 should not be needed.
 *
 *   @filename     Name of the output file.  (Not used for NTUPLE_TYPE_STRUCT)
 *
 *   @ftitle       File title.  (part of hbook and root files).
 *
 *   @server_port  Used for NTUPLE_TYPE_STRUCT.
 *
 *   @generate_header  Used for NTUPLE_TYPE_STRUCT_HH.  Hmm...
 *
 *   @timeslice    Generate new output file every so often seconds.
 *
 *   @timeslice_subdir  New timeslice subdirectory every so often seconds.
 *
 *   @autosave     Autosave the tree every so often seconds.
 *
 * - Call send_file_open() to make it open the output file.
 *
 * - Call send_book_ntuple() to create the ntuple/tree object.
 *
 *   @hid           [NTUPLE] Ntuple id.
 *
 *   @id            [TREE] Name of the ntuple, use for root trees.
 *
 *   @title         Title of the ntuple/tree.
 *
 *   @ntuple_index  (Usually 0) For having several ntuples (of
 *                  same layout) in the output file.
 *
 *   @sort_u32_words  Number of words used for sorting multiple streams.
 *                    (Only for ntuple_index = 0).
 *
 *   @max_raw_words  Maximum size of raw data.
 *                   (Only for ntuple_index = 0).
 *
 *   @struct_index  (Usually/first 0) For having several ntuples (of
 *                  different layout) in the output file.
 *
 * - Call send_alloc_array() to allocate the staging array.
 *
 *   @size       This should have the length of the structure that
 *               you want to dump.  NOTE: it can (currently) only
 *               contain 32-bit entries, i.e. basically 32-bit int,
 *		 uint, and floats.  int32_t and uint32_t are
 *		 recommended.  It may be arrays whose length are
 *		 controlled by some earlier integer.
 *
 * - For each member of the ntuple/tree, call send_hbname_branch().
 *
 *   @block        [NTUPLE] Name of the block to put the variable in.
 *
 *   @offset       Offset of the item in the staging structure (bytes).
 *
 *   @length       Length of the item (bytes).
 *
 *   @var_name     [STRUCT] Variable name, without array or type.
 *
 *   @var_array_len [STRUCT] Array length, or -1.  Fixed (max) length of
 *                  array, i.e. how much to allocate statically.
 *
 *   @var_ctrl_name [STRUCT] Array length control member, or "".
 *
 *   @var_type      [STRUCT] Variable type, see ext_file_writer.hh
 *                  EXTERNAL_WRITER_FLAG_TYPE_{INT32,UINT32,FLOAT32}
 *
 *   @limit_min    [NTUPLE] Minimum value.  Flag needed:
 *                 var_type |= EXTERNAL_WRITER_FLAG_HAS_LIMIT).
 *
 *   @limit_max    [NTUPLE] Maximum value.  Flag needed:
 *                 var_type |= EXTERNAL_WRITER_FLAG_HAS_LIMIT).
 *
 * - Call set_max_message_size() to reallocate the communication
 *   shm/pipe with enough space to handle the worst case message.
 *
 *   @size          The maximum message length is protocol dependent
 *                  (see below), currently 2 32-bit word + 1 32-bit
 *                  words per item sent.  Also consider the offset
 *                  message.  Specified in bytes.
 *
 *                  It does not include any max_raw_words, which is
 *                  added internally.
 *
 * - Call prepare_send_offsets() to give the fill order and offsets of
 *   all items that are to be filled.  Returns a pointer to an array
 *   where to put the information
 *
 *   @size          The length of the offset array.  Equal to the number
 *                  of items.
 *
 *   The information consists of, for each data item:
 *
 *   uint32_t       offset   (offset in the staging array of the item)
 *
 *                           In case of zero-suppressed arrays, they
 *                           must be directly preceeded by the
 *                           controlling variable, which offset is to
 *                           be OR marked with 0x80000000.  This is
 *                           followed by two values, max_loops and
 *                           loop_size, describing the following arrays.
 *                           The items of the arrays are then to be
 *                           given in round-robin order).
 *
 *                           All @offset are to written with htonl(), to
 *                           avoid endianess issues.
 *
 *                           Items that are to be cleared with 0 (e.g.
 *                           integers), should have a marker 0x40000000.
 *                           Otherwise, they are cleared with NaN.
 *
 * - When the information has been filled, call send_offsets_fill() to
 *   send it..
 *
 *   @o             Points to the next byte after the filled data.
 *
 * - Call send_setup_done() to tell that we're ready to fill.
 *
 *   @reader        If it is suppose to be a reader and not a writer.
 *
 * - For each event to fill, first call prepare_send_fill() to
 *   reserve space for the data to send, and also get a pointer where
 *   to put the data.
 *
 *   @size          Maximum size that will be used for the protocol data.
 *                  Can safely use the value sent to set_max_message_size().
 *
 *   @ntuple_index  (Usually 0) which ntuple to fill.
 *
 *   @sort_u32      Pointer to words used for sorting multiple streams.
 *
 *   @raw           Pointer to pointer (set during call) to location
 *                  where to write ancillary raw data of size @raw_words.
 *
 *   @raw_words     Size of raw data (bytes).
 *
 *   @struct_index  (Usually 0) which ntuple to fill.
 *
 *   The protocol consists of:
 *
 *   uint32_t       struct_index  (usually zero, non-zero with multiple
 *                                ntuples (of different layout) in the
 *                                output file)
 *
 *   uint32_t       ntuple_index  (usually zero, non- with multiple
 *                                ntuples (of same layout) in the
 *                                output file)
 *
 *   uint32_t       sort_u32[sort_u32_words]  Words to sort on when receiving
 *                                            multiple streams.  Highest word
 *                                            first.
 *
 *   uint32_t       marker = 0  (used internally by the external writer,
 *                              when sending data by the STRUCT server)
 *
 *   For each data item:
 *
 *   uint32_t       value    (value, see writing_ntuple.hh for
 *                           type-punning of floats) Both @offset and
 *                           @value are to be written with htonl(), to
 *                           avoid endianess issues.
 *
 *                           The values are to be given in the same
 *                           order as the offsets to
 *                           prepare_send_offsets().  In case of
 *                           zero-suppressed arrays, only as many
 *                           rounds as the controlling item prescribes
 *                           should be given.
 *
 * - When the event data has been filled, call send_offsets_fill() to
 *   tell how mush data was generated.
 *
 *   @p             Points to the next byte after the filled data.
 *
 * - Call close() to close the file when finished.  Calls send_done().
 *
 * - Delete the external_writer object.  This will call close() if needed.
 *
 * Example: see example/ext_writer_test.cc
