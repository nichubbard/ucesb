  Scheduling ideas.

  Limiting factor.  When compiled for multi-processing mode, the
  buffers (the input file buffer, pipe_buffer), does when full and
  reading wait for some space to be released by the retirement
  process.  So the record reading routine (lmd/pax/ebey/genf_input)
  may not be running in the same thread as the retirement routine.  So
  at least two threads are necessary.  If we make the number of event
  buffers, that may have the same requirement (not to run in the same
  thread as the retire routine.  The same may apply for the
  unpack->raw expansion(explosion) when unpacking multi-event data.

  The different tasks to be performed are to be ordered along with the
  threads.  I.e. the last task (retirement) is always performed by the
  last thread.  Whenever we need to free cpu-time, we'll move tasks up
  in the thread list.

  At startup, we have nothing to do but to start unpacking events.
  Therefore, at startup all threads (but the record reading, which
  produces the data) should be unpacking events.

  The main question is: how to figure out if a thread is swamped with
  work (they should all be).  And to figure out when a thread has too
  little to do.  

  We want to all threads (particularly the serial ones) to be able to
  survive the situation when any producer for it (particularly a
  singular one) gets scheduled away by the os for an execution block.
  (lets say 10 ms) I.e. the input buffers need to contain enough
  events.  With 10MB/s and 100 bytes/event, this 100000 events/s,
  i.e. 1000 events.  1000 events is then 100k data, i.e. large enough
  to vicitimize any L1 cache, and quite easilty also L2 caches (they
  also need to hold instructions and calibration parameters).  We can
  therefor say, that we need not consider the caching, i.e. to keep
  locality of the events.  The only exception we do to this is that of
  course, serial jobs that run in threads that also handle some
  parallell job, will handle these different tasks for the same event
  directly after each other.

  Let's make the main thread (i.e. the first one) responsible for:
  * stdin/out/err input/output, file open and close
  * thread monitoring (n-curses)
  * event retirement
  
  The unwanted part may be the event retirement, but since retirement
  is a light-weight task.  (No analysis, and no memory free, only some
  buffer releases (the free operations go into the treads, there are
  essentially no free, only an occasional munmap).  It may however
  also get some text data (error output) to be displayed.  (All such
  info is displayed in event order).  So then it's good that it has
  hold of the user I/O.

  Since it is such a light-weight operation, we however do not want to
  always fire the thread up, just to retire one more event.  But we
  also should not let the other treads wait for it to release
  memory...

  Anyhow, when the file reader (pipe_buffer, mmap) reaches EOF
  (i.e. long before the record reader (pre-unpacker) has consumed data
  so far), we can signal the main thread that another file should be
  opened and data start to be buffered.
